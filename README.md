# DBFilesClient.NET
A blazing-fast "new" DBC/DB2 reader for World of Warcraft.
Name is totally not stolen from [LordJZ's library](http://github.com/LordJZ/DBFilesClient.NET).

Built on top of [Sigil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Sigil).

## Planned features

1. Support more flavors of DB2 (WDB2, WDB3, WDB4)
2. Ultimately remove references to [Sigil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Sigil). It is a great library, but I only keep it because the code has a tendancy to encounter random errors during record loading. Debugging showed no difference in the IL generated by Sigil, and the standard .NET generator. Yet only Sigil's works.

## Performance

This section only refers to WDB5 DB2 files. 

Here are a few examples (randomly selected) of loading speeds for various files.
My work laptop has an i3-2310M CPU and 8Gb of DDR3 RAM.

Expected record count in the table below is calculated depending on field meta:
* If the file has an offset map, we count there.
* Otherwise, we use the record count in header.

We then add the amount of entries in the copy table.

```
File name                        Time to load        Record count   Expected   OK
