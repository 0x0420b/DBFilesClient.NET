# DBFilesClient.NET
A blazing-fast "new" DBC/DB2 reader for World of Warcraft.
Name is totally not stolen from [LordJZ's library](http://github.com/LordJZ/DBFilesClient.NET).

Built on top of [Sigil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Sigil).

## Planned features

1. Support more flavors of DB2 (WDB3, WDB4)
2. Ultimately remove references to [Sigil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Sigil). It is a great library, but I only keep it because the code has a tendancy to encounter random errors during record loading. Debugging showed no difference in the IL generated by Sigil, and the standard .NET generator. Yet only Sigil's works.

## Usage

As well as exposing its standard `Storage<T>` type, the library exposes a `DBFileNameAttribute`. This attribute binds a file name to a structure. Use cases include loading a lot of files through reflection. The code below, snipped off the tests library, shows how to use this attribute.

```csharp
foreach (var type in Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof (ReaderTest)).GetTypes())
{
    if (!type.IsClass)
        continue;

    var attr = type.GetCustomAttribute<DBFileNameAttribute>();
    if (attr == null)
        continue;

    var instanceType = typeof (Storage<>).MakeGenericType(type);
    var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(instanceType, $@"{attr.FileName}.db2");
    ...
}
```

Regular instantiation goes by

```csharp
var instance = new Storage<AreaTriggerEntry>("AreaTrigger.db2");
```

Note that `Storage<T>` behaves like a `Dictionary<int, T>`.

### File formats and structures

For all file formats, you should provide reference-type structures to the library. Fields (and not properties, though that is subject to changes in the future) will get loaded in the order they are defined.

Bidimentional arrays are not supported; neither are collections.

#### WDBC & WDB2

Nothing special here, just mark arrays with MarshalAsAttribute, specifying the size.

```c#
public sealed class AreaTableEntry
{
    [MarshalAs(UnManagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = ...)]
    public uint[] Flags;
    public string ZoneName;
    public float AmbientMultiplier;
    public string AreaName;
    public ushort MapID;
    ...
}
```

#### WDB5

Due to the nature of the WDB5 format, arrays do not need *always* an explicit size defined through attributes. Size is inferred from the file.

However, the code has difficulty to determine the size of arrays at the end of the record. You can make sure your array is properly loaded by decorating that field with a `MarshalAsAttribute`. Otherwise, we do our best at guessing, but note that there will be no exception for this field.


```c#
public sealed class AreaTableEntry
{
    // MarshalAsAttribute here does not improve anything
    public uint[] Flags;
    public string ZoneName;
    public float AmbientMultiplier;
    public string AreaName;
    public ushort MapID;
    ...
    // Optional, but use it if you want to be safe
    [MarshalAs(UnManagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = ...)]
    public int[] Element;
}
```

Providing explicit array size for non-ending fields can also be done, but it will most likely be redundant.

## Performance

This section only refers to WDB5 DB2 files. 

Here are a few examples (randomly selected) of loading speeds for various files.
My work laptop has an i3-2310M CPU and 8Gb of DDR3 RAM.

Expected record count in the table below is calculated depending on field meta:
* If the file has an offset map, we count there.
* Otherwise, we use the record count in header.

We then add the amount of entries in the copy table.

```
File name                        Time to load        Record count   Expected   OK
